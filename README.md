# ⌨️ Hello World!

## 📖 About Me

💻 I'm a current Sophomore double majoring in **Computer Science** and **Artificial Intelligence** at **Drake University**.

🌱 I've learned and made projects in both **Python and Java**. As well, I'm currently learning **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Currently working on a project involving **C# and SQL**.

⚡ I've always been a computer lover, whether it's software or hardware, whether it's the computer or the peripherals. I enjoy learning and am always trying to push myself to be better, both in and out of my IDEs.

📫 You can reach me directly through LinkedIn, which also has my other forms of contact (email and phone).

💞️ Always open to new opportunities, collaborating, and diving into learning environments.
