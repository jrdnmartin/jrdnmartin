# ⌨️ Hello World!

## 📖 About Me

💻 I am currently a Junior double majoring in **Computer Science** and **Artificial Intelligence** at **Drake University**.

🌱 I have experience building projects using **Python** and **Java**, and I am actively expanding my skills in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. I’m currently working on a weather dashboard project leveraging **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.

⚡ Technology has always been my passion—whether it’s software development, hardware, or even peripherals. I thrive on challenges and am constantly seeking to grow and improve both inside and outside of my IDEs.

📫 Feel free to connect with me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanomartin/)**, where you can also find my contact details, including email and phone.

💞️ I’m always open to new opportunities, collaborative projects, and engaging in dynamic learning environments.
