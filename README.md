# ⌨️ Hello World!

## 📖 About Me

# Hey, I'm Jordan 👋

I build real-world software systems at the intersection of **AI, data, and systems engineering** — with a focus on reliability, ethics, and user impact.

I’m a computer science student with experience taking ideas from concept to production, working across backends, APIs, data pipelines, and user-facing interfaces.

---

## 🧠 What I’m Working On
- Full-stack applications using **Flask, React, Docker, and Cloud infrastructure**
- Computer vision & analytics systems designed for real operational constraints
- Portfolio projects built with production quality in mind

---

## 🚀 Selected Projects
- **Archeway** – A full-stack job tracking platform with analytics, workflow tools, and OAuth  
- **Real-Time Analytics & Surveillance System** – Multi-camera detection, tracking, and privacy-aware processing  
- **Production Web Integrations** – API payload builders, form automation, logging, and deployment for real clients


---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, SQL  
**Backend:** Flask, Node.js, REST APIs  
**Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS  
**Data & AI:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, Computer Vision  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, GitHub Actions, Cloudflare, Linux  
**Other:** OAuth, system design, logging & observability

## 💡 What I Care About
- Building systems that hold up outside of demos  
- Designing for real constraints: latency, privacy, failure modes  
- Ethical and explainable AI-driven decision systems  
- Clean architecture and long-term maintainability
